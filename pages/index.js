        <p>Hi, this is my description. This is first ever website I've ever built wiht Nextjs and I hope that it will be the first of many others. The tutorial is great so far (not like the one and Angular). My next goal will be to create a wonderful website to present myself and my skills to get a really high paid job in the domain I like.</p>
